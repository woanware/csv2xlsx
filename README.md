# csv2xlsx

Console application to convert CSV files into XSLX format. Why would you want to do that, you might ask? Well if you have CSV files with fields that contain long numbers, then they get truncated when you double click open the CSV file, so this generates an XSLX file with the column formatting set to "text", which stops the truncation, and you don't need to use the Import Wizard.
